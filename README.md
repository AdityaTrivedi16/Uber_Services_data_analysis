# Uber_Services_data_analysis

## •	In this project I have conducted Exploratory Data Analysis using Python in Jupyter Notebook on Uber dataset containing over 150k rows/ records and 4 columns/ features to find out hourly demand patterns on different days of the week in New York city.
## •	By examining traffic/rush during weekdays and weekends, we gain insights into customer travel preferences and behavior. 
## •	Understanding when customers are more likely to use Uber can help optimize driver availability and reduce wait times, can help Uber in allocating resources effectively to meet customer demand during peak hours enhancing the overall customer experience. 
## •	Also, the Demand vs Supply chart shows the average trips per vehicle which helps us know the performance of each dispatching base number and active vehicles.
